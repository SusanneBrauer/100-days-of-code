# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 6, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Planned for the journey ahead

**Thoughts:** I think doing the CodeCademy course from the start and working on the Portfolio website is a good start. The Sims Tracker will be a bit of a left field thing to work on but I think I can work with a number of technologies of it and maybe some other plays find it useful in the end. I also need to have another look at my portfoliosite to se what I want to hange and to add the missing responsiveness.

So essentially there will be 3 work streams:
1) CodeCademy Full Stack Path
2) Update and improve portfolio website
3) Creat Sims Tracker
4) blog for direct practice documenting the journey

**Plan For Today**:
- Finish HTML FUndamentals Chapter on the CodeCademy course
- Layout Simstracker landing page (logged in/logged out?)
- Layout Sims Household summary page for Simtracker
- Layout single Sims summary page for Simstracker
- setup HTML for blog summary page (blog maybe about this journey and gamesfor the moment it'll be mostly for practice at this point)
*going to add the blog to work streams in Day 0 list*
