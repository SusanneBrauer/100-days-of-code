# 100 Days Of Code - Log

[Week 1](#week1)  
[Week 2](#week2)  

### Day 0: March 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Planned for the journey ahead

**Thoughts:** I think doing the CodeCademy course from the start and working on the Portfolio website is a good start. The Sims Tracker will be a bit of a left field thing to work on but I think I can work with a number of technologies of it and maybe some other plays find it useful in the end. I also need to have another look at my portfoliosite to se what I want to hange and to add the missing responsiveness.

So essentially there will be 3 work streams:

1. CodeCademy Full Stack Path
2. Update and improve portfolio website
3. Create Sims Tracker
4. blog for direct practice documenting the journey

### Day 1: March 7, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Finish HTML FUndamentals Chapter on the CodeCademy course [X]
- Layout Simstracker landing page (logged in/logged out?) [X]
- Layout Sims Household summary page for Simtracker [ ]
- Layout single Sims summary page for Simstracker [ ]
- setup HTML for blog summary page (blog maybe about this journey and gamesfor the moment it'll be mostly for practice at this point) [X]
  _going to add the blog to work streams in Day 0 list_

**Today's Progress**: Studying, layouting and my little blog

**Thoughts:** I have completed the HTML chapter of my course, I really like the idea of the semantic tags. I have then used the HTML to start writing this little blog using those skills as my practice for the day. I will add a link to the blog to the work links below.  
My project, which will be a website to track details for Sims in The Sims 4â„¢, still needs some layout work before I can dive into writing actual code for it so the coding for that will be part of the challenge later. I did some first laytou work on the project but as much as I was hoping to do as I was spend more time working through the course and writing this blog which in way felt more important in the scope of the challenge.

### Day 2: March 8, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Finish CSS Fundamentals Chapter on the CodeCademy Course [X]
- add CSS to the Blog [X]
- start coding HTML for Sims tracker landing page [X]
- Layout Sims Household summary page for Simtracker [ ]
- Layout single Sims summary page for Simstracker [ ]

**Today's Progress**: Styling galore and setting up the Sims Tracker project also set up git for my work

**Thoughts:** The day got away from me a little so it was late night, but I managed to get through my Fundamentals of CSS chapter as planned. And put some first CSS on my blog and it is starting to look a little nicer.
In the CSS chapter there were quite a few things I was familiar with from some previous studying, but there were also some new things. Fro example the sticky positioning option was new to me. I also finally got a better understanding of positioning and of the clear property which was a bit of mystery to me before.  
I also finally set git up properly to track my work on the projects, but that is part of what was eating some of my time.  
For the Sims Tracker it got late to get on with the layout and to do some proper work on the landing page, so I just setup the webspace and wrote a little placeholder with some HTML and CSS.  
So I didn't get all my tasks done but I'm still happy with what did get done ine the end.

### Day 3: March 9, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Course work on local developing and website deployment [X]
- HTML/CSS for Sims tracker landing page [X]
- Layout Sims Household summary page for Simtracker [ ]
- Layout single Sims summary page for Simstracker [ ]
- further style improvement on Blog [ ]

**Today's Progress**: First "free"(or local) Codecademy project and proper start on Sims Tracker project.

**Thoughts:** I have done the chapters on my course that I planned to do, but they were mostly things I was already aware of, but in the end there was a little project in create a website as per a give example and specs which was a nice exercise and I will link the result in the link here.  
I have done more work on the Sims Tracker landing page and but I will leave the place holder page in place at the domain until some actual functionality is in place there. So if you want to follow along with the progress I will post updates and pictures here or you can follow along on my github account. So this what hte landing page looks like now. The little banner oin the header is not ideal just yet but I did not want to spend a ton of time on the picture and get to working on the code.The next step putting a sign up form below then this piece will be done in its static form and I can move on to the next part.
![Sims Tracker Landing Day 3 Status](images/landing-page-day3-status.png)  
Yes I said a sign up form and yes there is a login button at the top right there. I think the actual functionality for those is still realatively far in the future, but I do want this to be something people can actually use so it'll need some kind of account system and database behind it. While this is somewhat intimidating at this point in time, learning how to make that work is something I really look forward to and part of why I chose this project.  
So Overall I would have liked to get a bit more work done on sprucing up this blog, but sometimes the days are just not long enough. SO I didn't get everything done but I'm happy with the things I did get done.

### Day 4: March 10, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Course work: chapter Improved Styling with CSS (not sure if I can make all of it but I will try) [X]
- HTML/CSS for Sims tracker landing page Sign up form [X]
- further style improvement on Blog [ ]
- Have a look at revamping my Portfolio [ ]

**Today's Progress**: CSS colors and typography; Forms without function

**Thoughts:** I have not gotten too much done today, as I had some doctors apointments and I need to recover from the last couple of late nights of coding.  
I have done some good work on the simstracker though reactivating coding my knowledge about forms to create the sign up form on the landing page. I want to put a little more polish on it tomorrow by putting a green frame on the active input box. I can't quite remeber how that worked, but I recall that it was possible, so I will have a look at that tomorrow. The page looks like this now:  
![Sims Tracker Landing Day 4 Status](images/landing-page-day4-status.png)  
For the Course work I have done more CSS mostly on colors and typography which was mostly familiar but still good to re-do and reactivate the knowledge. I'm planning to finish the chapter tomorrow it's quite a a long one though but I want to get out of the familiar zone so I can take another shot at under JavaScript.  
I think the work on polishing the blog and planning the portfolio revamp will have to wait till over the weekend. I need to get better at gauging how much work I can get done in a day. I don't like these half finished lists! I think I will also have to start bundlling the days up for the blog in some improvised from of pagination to keep some sort of order.

### Day 5: March 11, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Course work: Finish improved CSS chapter[ ]
- polish sign up form on sims Tracker landing page [X]
- start HTML for Sims Tracker dashboard [ ]
- Have a look at revamping my Portfolio [ ]

**Today's Progress**: Slow day, not much done.

**Thoughts:** It's been a slow da on the code front. There was a lot going on thorugh ut the day, so I did not get to spend nearly as mch time as I would have liked with coding or learning.  
Therefore not much progress on the course, but ome interesting pointers into making sure that clickable elements are recognised as such and how to best do that.
I did do some small bits of work on the nave to split the journal and projet/challenge nav elemenets. I have also decided that once the first 7 days are done I will bundel the journal entries into weeks to make some sort readable pagination.  
On The Sims trackers I merly made some changes to the login in and sign up button to make them more 'buttony" and I added a border change to the active inputfields. Again not much but all I had time for today.  
I shall make up for missed time tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Good progress after some rest. Forms, tables, typography

**Thoughts:** First things first, yes I was naughty and skipped a day. I just needed some rest after what has been a busy a week and still recovering from being so poorly for a rather long time. But baack in full force today.  
I have finished the next CSS chapter all about tables, form and font. I took that and used to work on the Sims Tracker project writing the HTML for the login page and changing the Sign up form. to nest the text input into the lable element, which I have never done before but saw in the course and found rather elegant.  
I also made use of the tables when setting up the dashboard with as staic page with made up examples. the structure and layout for it still need work though.  
It is coming together, so I'm happy.

**Thoughts:** Today was overall a bit lighter on programming but I have learned much about grids which I plan to put to work for the Sims Tracker tomorrow.  
I have done a fair amount of concept work today. With a tool called Figma. I'm so far really happy using it for working out the concepts. I shall put these into prcatice over the next couple of days.

### Day 8: March 20, 2022

**Plan For Today**:

- Course work: Finish the flexbox section project [X]
- introduce week views on the blog [X]
- transfer layout updates into simstracker project [ ]

**Today's Progress**: Back on track! CodeCademy flexbox project. Flexbox is mighty!

**Thoughts:** After a week of medical things to sort and getting back into my day job I'm finally back on this journey.  
              I have started with finishing off the Flexbox section of my CodeCademy Course and I do love flexbox there are so many possibilities. The project was essentiall writing up a little website and styling it using flexbox , but it also needed soemposition ing things that I was happy to practice. I got on rather well with that project. There is a link to the compled project below just look for the CodeCademy Project Tea Cozy in the link section below. If you want to see the concept that was given as a guideline to what the project was meant to look like you can find that in the respective repository on my github.  
              With the might of flexbox at my hands I some work on the navigation for the blog and finally implemented the week nav as well as some additional cleaning up. There is a few more things I want to clean up. I also added some additional future weeks so I can just go and fill them in as I go along, which will make updating this blog a bit quicker (so far up to week 4, the other weeks will still be empty links).  
              I hope I can do some work tomorrow but I will have to see how much I will get to do after my morning appointment.
