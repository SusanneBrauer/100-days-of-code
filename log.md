# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 6, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Planned for the journey ahead

**Thoughts:** I think doing the CodeCademy course from the start and working on the Portfolio website is a good start. The Sims Tracker will be a bit of a left field thing to work on but I think I can work with a number of technologies of it and maybe some other plays find it useful in the end. I also need to have another look at my portfoliosite to se what I want to hange and to add the missing responsiveness.

So essentially there will be 3 work streams:
1) CodeCademy Full Stack Path
2) Update and improve portfolio website
3) Create Sims Tracker
4) blog for direct practice documenting the journey

### Day 1: March 7, 2022

**Plan For Today**:
- ~~Finish HTML FUndamentals Chapter on the CodeCademy course~~
- ~~Layout Simstracker landing page (logged in/logged out?)~~
- Layout Sims Household summary page for Simtracker
- Layout single Sims summary page for Simstracker
- ~~setup HTML for blog summary page (blog maybe about this journey and gamesfor the moment it'll be mostly for practice at this point)~~
*going to add the blog to work streams in Day 0 list*

**Today's Progress**: Studying, layouting and my little blog

**Thoughts:** I have completed the HTML chapter of my course, I really like the idea of the semantic tags. I have then used the HTML to start writing this little blog using those skills as my practice for the day. I will add a link to the blog to the work links below
My project, which will be a website to track details for Sims in The Sims 4â„¢, still needs some layout work before I can dive into writing actual code for it so the coding for that will be part of the challenge later. I did some first laytou work on the project but as much as I was hoping to do as I was spend more time working through the course and writing this blog which in way felt more important in the scope of the challenge.
